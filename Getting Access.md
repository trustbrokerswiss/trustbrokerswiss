# Getting Access
Currently we are preparing the Trust Broker Swiss Open Source release. The proper release will be published by end of first quarter 2024.

Until then we can provide a "special release" with a special licence on demand. Requests will be evaluated and will be approved under specific conditions. Only requests from cantonal employees in context AGOV will be considered at the moment.
