# Getting Access
Currently we are preparing the Trust Broker Swiss Open Source release. The proper release will be published by end of first quarter 2024.

Until then we can provide a "special release" with a special licence on demand. Requests will be evaluated and will be approved under specific conditions. Only requests from cantonal employees in context AGOV will be considered at the moment.

To request access please state your request in ["How to get access to the repository"](https://github.com/trustbrokerswiss/trustbrokerswiss/discussions/2). We'll contact you.
